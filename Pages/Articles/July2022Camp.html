                    As 2022-2023 synchro season comes to a close, it is only right to reflect on our first
                    ELEVATE
                    Synchronized Skating Camp. Founded by Haydenette Laura Nicula and Miami Senior member Brynn
                    LaMear, ELEVATE brought together hard-working athletes and world-renowned coaches to create
                    a
                    lasting impact on the synchronized skating community of the greater St. Louis area.

                <p>As 2022 comes to a close, it is only right to reflect on the first annual ELEVATE
                    Synchronized
                    Skating
                    Camp.
                    Founded by Babson College student and Haydenette Laura Nicula, ELEVATE brought together
                    hard-working
                    athletes and world-renowned coaches to create a lasting impact on the synchronized skating
                    community
                    of
                    the
                    greater St. Louis area.
                </p>
                <p>ELEVATE welcomed athletes of all ages and skill levels by dividing skaters into two groups to
                    better
                    accommodate each individual's strengths and goals. Group White and Group Pink attended both
                    on and
                    off-ice
                    sessions to develop the techniques and mental toughness needed for competitions.
                </p>
                <p>During the off-ice portion of the camp, skaters met with Miami University Senior Varsity
                    Synchronized
                    Skating Team members Brynn LaMear, Justine Ferrer, and Hannah McDougall to discuss the
                    importance of
                    goal-setting. Skaters learned the three types of goals and how to maximize their
                    goal-setting
                    efforts
                    using
                    the S.M.A.R.T. method. Skaters were even able to brainstorm and pitch ideas for their own
                    synchro
                    program!
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>In a session focusing on positive mindset, skaters were taught by Hayden Synchro members Laura
                Nicula,
                Maddie Beery, and Haley Weilbacher to utilize self-talk as a way to reinforce a growth mindset.
                Overcoming a
                fixed mindset is critical to maintaining a healthy relationship with skating, and it instills a
                sense of
                perseverance that can be relied on during challenging times.
            </p>
            <p>The groups also attended an off-ice skating class where they were taught the no-hold element
                from
                the
                Haydenettes 2021-2022 short program “Sweet Dreams”. This was a fun and unique way to encourage
                skaters
                to
                fully mimic what they do on the ice when they are off the ice. Practicing programs off the ice can
                be an
                effective way to reinforce arms, head guides, and extensions so that on-ice time can be used to
                practice
                elements rather than “the little details”.

            </div>
            <p>The final two off-ice classes of the ELEVATE 2022 Camp were dancing and interpretive movement
                followed
                by stretching and recovery. The first of these two classes focused on improving the skaters'
                component
                score. In the component score, skaters are graded on their performance and their musical
                interpretation.
                Skaters performed exercises to enhance their awareness of different pieces of music. They were also
                asked to
                create their own off-ice routine! Skaters then transitioned to the stretching and recovery class
                where
                they
                were introduced to new stretches to target muscles throughout the body, and the importance of taking
                care of
                one's body after a long week of training was emphasized.
            </p>
            <p>While the off-ice classes were helpful, the on-ice sessions were where the real fun began!
                ELEVATE
                started with a skating skills and drills class to build a strong foundation that skaters could add
                to
                throughout the duration of the camp. Skaters performed drills that concentrated on knee and ankle
                bend,
                as
                well as body alignment. Skaters later attended a second skills and drills session aimed at enhancing
                their
                “synchro skills”. This session was dedicated to tracking and presentation, both of which are crucial
                for
                a
                strong technical and artistic program.
            </p>
            <p>During the final two days of camp, skaters worked to strengthen specific aspects of their
                skating.
                Attendees were informed of the importance of having clean turns and twizzles in their program. They
                were
                also given the opportunity to perform these skills and receive feedback on how to improve them. To
                ensure
                every area of their skating was improved upon, campers attended sessions focusing on posture and
                carriage,
                as well as generating power with each push. They were taught effective drills that current Team USA
                athletes
                use to better their own skating.
            </p>
            <p>ELEVATE also feels so fortunate to have had guest coaches Sharon Neff and Adam Blake in
                attendance!
                Sharon is a former Haydenette, 2x World Medalist, and 5x National Champion. She led skaters in a fun
                pair
                elements and tricks class! Adam Blake is a world-renowned choreographer and head coach of the best
                Theater
                on Ice team in the US. He served as an assistant coach of the Haydenettes for two years and has
                worked
                with
                Disney on Ice. In an exciting on-ice session that combined both groups, he taught skaters a unique
                hip-hop
                choreography sequence to a popular K-pop song!
            </p>
            <p>While both skaters and coaches had an amazing three days together, ELEVATE left an impact
                lasting
                months
                beyond the camp. Skaters were given a half-zip bearing the ELEVATE logo, in addition to a folder to
                store
                all of their goals and motivational tips to help them throughout the long synchro season. ELEVATE,
                however,
                is most proud of the creation of the ELEVATE fund through the Metro Edge Figure Skating Club. This
                fund
                stores the proceeds from the camp and was able to be used toward the Saint Louis Synergy Junior
                Team's
                expenses during the 2022-2023 season.

                have
                worked with eager and talented young athletes, and we hope to do so again this summer! Remember to
